## I. INSTRUCTION

### Read and comprehend the expected output for each task then perform them according to your group designation. 

## II. OBJECTIVES

### Use MATLAB as a tool for simulating block diagram algebra.

## III. BACKGROUND

### Block Diagram: 
### <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Block diagrams*** are graphical representations of systems or processes using blocks to represent components and lines to represent the relationships between these components. In Control Systems Engineering, block diagrams are widely used to visualize the interconnections and functions of various elements within a control system.</div>

### Block Diagram Algebra:
### <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Block Diagram Algebra*** is a mathematical tool used to manipulate block diagrams to simplify and analyze complex systems. It involves operations such as addition, multiplication, and feedback manipulation to obtain an equivalent representation of the system.</div>
